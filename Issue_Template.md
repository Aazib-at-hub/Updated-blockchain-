## Project Title
blockchain[OpenTekHub]

## Problem Description:

Currently in OpenTekHub, the only search option is to search the full name of the cryptocurrency, like BITCOIN and ETHEREUM only.
I have edited the script.js file to allow Searches with the symbols too like:

BTC --> BITCOIN

ETH --> ETHEREUM

SOL --> SOLANA

## Need for this fix

Since in the vast pool of cryptocurrencies, a frequent trader would prefer if they could check the prices with only the unique symbols instead of the complete name which coulg get repetitive and time consuming.

## Reproducing the Issue

- Visit the deployed website [here](https://opentekhub.github.io/blockchain/)
- Try Searching for the preferred Crypto using their Symbol (like BTC for BITCOIN)
- Error : "Cryptocurrency not found!"
